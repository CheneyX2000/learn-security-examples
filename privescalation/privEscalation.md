# Privilege Escalation

The example demonstrates a privilege escalation vulnerability and how to exploit it.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install all dependencies

   `$ npm install`

2. Start the **insecure.ts** server

   `$ npx ts-node insecure.ts`

3. In the browser, send a GET request

   ```
       http://localhost:3000/send-form
   ```

4. Try different UserIds and see which one gives you authorized access to change the role of that user.

## For you to do

Answer the following:

1. Briefly explain the potential vulnerabilities in **insecure.ts**
   Lack of Authentication: The server trusts the userId provided in the request body without verifying the identity of the requester.

   Improper Authorization Logic: It checks if the user associated with the input userId is an admin, rather than checking if the actual requester is an admin.

   Privilege Escalation Risk: Any user can submit a request claiming to be an admin and change roles, bypassing proper access control.

2. Briefly explain how a malicious attacker can exploit them.
   A non-admin user can craft a POST request like:
   {
   "userId": 1,
   "newRole": "admin"
   }
   Since insecure.ts checks the role of the userId in the request and not the actual requester, the attacker impersonates an admin (e.g., userId = 1), and the server allows them to update any userâ€™s role.

   This leads to unauthorized elevation of privileges, letting attackers become admins or promote others.

3. Briefly explain the defensive techniques used in **secure.ts** to prevent the privilege escalation vulnerability?
   Session-Based Authentication: Tracks the logged-in user using req.session.userId, preventing users from faking identities via input.

   Proper Authorization Check: Verifies the role of the authenticated user (from session) rather than trusting data from the request body.

   Role-Based Access Control: Only allows users with the admin role to perform role updates, ensuring access is restricted to authorized personnel.
